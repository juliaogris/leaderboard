I really don't care much about this repo anymore, but the amount of security alerts I had on it
because of old, bad npm modules..... it concerns me. Don't want any of this again.
But what is security anyway.

Ok, bye leaderboard, you come form a time where I tought I could fit it. :sad:

# Leaderboard

_Leaderboard_ aggregates data by GitHub user on:

- merged PRs (Pull Requests)
- open and merged PRs
- PR reviews
- PR review comments

on [anz-bank/go-course](https://github.com/anz-bank/go-course).

## Development

This projects consist of a backend written in `go` and a frontend build with
`ReactJS`.

The GitHub API is not directly queried by frontend because of rate limiting and
performance as well as user experience and authentication concerns.

### Backend

Code location: `backend`
Language: `go`

The backend is concerned with PR data retrieval from GitHub API v4 (GraphQL)
and transformation into aggregated, chartable data.

#### Prerequisites

- Install [go 1.12](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- Install [golangci-lint 1.16](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint#install)
- Install `make`

#### Make

Build, test, lint and check coverage for this project with

    cd backend
    make

Produce a coverage report with

    make cover

Run the project with

    make run

Alternatively execute the commands given in the [`Makefile`](backend/Makefile)
separately in your terminal.

### Frontend

Code location: `frontend`
Language: `ReactJS`

The frontend visualises PR stats as a series of bar charts. It retrieves the
underlying processed and aggregated PR data as JSON and renders somewhat
interactive SVG bar charts.

#### Prerequisites

- Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)
- Install `make`

#### Make

Build, test and lint the frontend with

    cd frontend
    make

Alternatively execute the commands given in the
[`Makefile`](frontend/Makefile). The details of the yarn commands can be found
in [`package.json`](frontend/package.json).

##### Run in development mode

Start stubbed backend service in one terminal

    make serve-stub

Run frontend in ReactJS development mode with in separate terminal

    make start

##### View coverage report in file watch mode

    make cover

##### Serve build output

    make serve-build

## CI

CI (Continuous Integration) runs on Google Cloudbuilds and is configured in
[`cloudbuilds.yaml`](cloudbuilds.yaml).
The linked Google Cloud build project is
[`gotraining`](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/triggers?project=gotraining),
request access from [@juliaogris](https://github.com/juliaogris) if needed.

Builds can bet triggered locally with:

    gcloud builds submit

`.gcloudignore` holds files not to be uploaded to Cloudbuilds (`.git`, `frontend/node_modules`).

## Deployment

The build output of frontend has been manually deployed to Google Cloud storage
bucket `leader.go-course.org`.
The backend is deployed as Google Cloud function with HTTP trigger:

    gcloud functions deploy LeaderboardHTTP \
        --runtime go111 \
        --timeout=300 \
        --trigger-http \
        --set-env-vars=GITHUB_TOKEN=$GITHUB_TOKEN

It is also deployed as Google Cloud function with PubSub event trigger to be used
with Google Cloud Scheduler:

    gcloud functions deploy LeaderboardEvent \
        --runtime go111 \
        --timeout=300 \
        --trigger-topic=schedule \
        --set-env-vars=GITHUB_TOKEN=$GITHUB_TOKEN

`$GITHUB_TOKEN` must contain a valid GitHub access token.

The linked Google Cloud build project is
[`gotraining`](https://console.cloud.google.com/functions/list?project=gotraining),
request access from [@juliaogris](https://github.com/juliaogris) if needed.
